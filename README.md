_a thing for viewing your NFthings_

nifthing?

## What is it?

In it's current form: a browser extension (for Chrome/Brave) that shows a random NFT from your collection every time you open a new tab.

## How does it work?

1. Download the extension (will be in Chrome store soon!)
2. Load the extension & enable
3. Open new tab
4. Click "keep it" when asked if you want to this to be your new tab
5. Click on "gear icon"
6. Enter your wallet
7. Click sync

It pulls your NFTs (at least, your first 1000) from OpenSea & caches their IDs.
And gives you a random one when you open a new tab.

## Why?

We (at the ambition.wtf team) ðŸ’š NFTs. We are excited by the possible futures that have been unlocked. However,

**what do you do with NFTs?**

Well. Good question. _What do you do with art?_

You hang it up on your wall.

That's what we want to do with our NFTs.

This is our first step into the creation, decoration, and curation of your own digital ambiance.
