  [x] fetch assets
    [x] fetch first 100
    [x] @bylaunch fetch more than 100
  [x] persist asset contract address & tokenId for each one

NITPICKY SHIT:
  [x] @bylaunch space between emojis
  [ ] random shouldn't pick the same one again

Initial Setup:
  [ ] @bylaunch make an initial loading screen
    [ ] setting the wallet really easy the first time
    [ ] so you don't have to open settings

Visuals:
  [x] change the text color (white/black) based on whether the BG is light/dark
  [ ] show the buttons on mouse move, fade them out after 1 sec

View Customization:
  [ ] @bylaunch Include name of NFT
  [ ] Background customization
    [ ] turn dominant color on/off
    [ ] blurred scaled-up
  [ ] Frame around NFT
    [ ] check attribute rarities !?

Future:
  [ ] Include links to OpenSea detail
  [ ] @bylaunch Include ArtSee dev information in corner
    [ ] eg: dev build v0.1
    [ ] Join our Discord to request features or report bugs
    [ ] show abbreviated wallet address
  [ ] create grayscale version of artsee emojis for loading
  [ ] Auto syncing...?
    [ ] check every load → get any new ones 
  [x] button → Show most recent one 
  [x] button → Show random one
  [ ] add custom name / add note ?
  [ ] show acquired date



NFT support:
  [ ] @bylaunch filter out .eth domains
    [ ] just add a hide NFT button, much easier
  [ ] @bylaunch "animation_url" for .mp4
  [ ] @bylaunch interative artblocks (iframe)

MAYBE:
  [ ] Try to get wallet address from MetaMask
  [ ] use "background_color" if set on OpeSea asset
