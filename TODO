TODO:
  [ ] checklist for releasing

CLEANUP:
  [ ] package depedencies
  [ ] console.logs
  [ ] unused files from templates
  [ ] TODOs

FULLSCREEN:
  [ ] Settings:
    [ ] White / Black / Grey BG
    [ ] Remember expanded / closed 

  When we make filter collections, add option to open new ones sequentially instead of randomly 

NEXT:
  [x] fullscreen
  [ ] set up website - should be same repo?
  [ ] use the new Collections endpoint
  [ ] Artists are sometimes incorrect
  (it says who it's minted by)
  (like satman's says minted by him)
  [ ] how to structure monorepo?
  [ ] or should I just make an artsee.wtf?

BUGS:
  [ ] sync, clear wallet, sync again → we get duplicates
  [ ] sometimes the detail thing doesn't show up
  [ ] responsive breakpoints
  [ ] sometimes the controls don't show up for FULLSCREEN

  [x] fix the initial shadow bug loading for Jeff's

  [x] logo size on load
  [x] MAYBE - support .eth domains

  https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/36719803494851039880066145456282917715064893508771189490274221064385390968833

FUTURE:
  [ ] Frame around NFT
  [ ] check attribute rarities !?
  [ ] show abbreviated wallet address ??
  [ ] improve background experience
  [ ] performance ??
  [ ] add the expand/contract button "cinematic mode"
  [ ] add little hover tooltips for the buttons (or make text?)
  [ ] just add a hide NFT button, much easier
  [ ] Background customization
  [ ] turn dominant color on/off
  [ ] blurred scaled-up
  [ ] light/dark

  [ ] City mode
  [ ] show NFTs on the side of a building
  [ ] bill board mode
  [ ] all kinds of shit

  [ ] get data from artblocks API

MAYBE:
  [ ] Try to get wallet address from MetaMask
  [ ] use "background_color" if set on OpeSea asset
  [ ] OPTION to prefer "original_url"? (loads slower, higher bandwidth)
  [ ] customize the controls button transition, so it slides out, but then returns with 0 opacity so that if you click in the same spot, still works
  [ ] add custom title name / add note ?
  [ ] show acquired date
  [x] make .eth domains work when typing in wallet address

Some Shit:
  [ ] put the releases on Github
  [ ] add error messaging
  [ ] make loading state clearer
