Next:
  [x] Svelte
  [x] Tailwind
  [x] Mini settings panel
    [x] fetch first 100 your opensea objects (SYNC)

    https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/
  [x] @bylaunch PERF: dont overwrite if already the same?

Data:
  [x] persist wallet address
  [x] persist last time fully synced
  [x] fetch assets
    [x] fetch first 100
    [x] @bylaunch fetch more than 100
  [x] persist asset contract address & tokenId for each one

NITPICKY SHIT:
  [x] @bylaunch space between emojis
  [ ] random shouldn't pick the same one again

Initial Setup:
  [ ] @bylaunch make an initial loading screen
    [ ] setting the wallet really easy the first time
    [ ] so you don't have to open settings

Visuals:
  [x] change the text color (white/black) based on whether the BG is light/dark
  [x] show the buttons on mouse move, fade them out after a bit
    [ ] customize the transition, so it slides out, but then returns with 0 opacity so that if you click in the same spot, still works
UI:
  [ ] add error messaging
  [ ] make loading state clearer


View Customization:
  [ ] @bylaunch Include name of NFT
  [ ] Background customization
    [ ] turn dominant color on/off
    [ ] blurred scaled-up
  [ ] Frame around NFT
    [ ] check attribute rarities !?

Future:
  [ ] Include links to OpenSea detail
  [ ] @bylaunch Include ArtSee dev information in corner
    [ ] eg: dev build v0.1
    [ ] Join our Discord to request features or report bugs
    [ ] show abbreviated wallet address
  [ ] create grayscale version of artsee emojis for loading
  [ ] Auto syncing...?
    [ ] check every load → get any new ones 
  [x] button → Show most recent one 
  [x] button → Show random one
  [ ] add custom name / add note ?
  [ ] show acquired date
  [ ] add donate ETH button
  


NFT support:
  [ ] @bylaunch filter out .eth domains
    [ ] just add a hide NFT button, much easier
  [x] @bylaunch "animation_url" for .mp4
  [x] @bylaunch interative artblocks (iframe)

MAYBE:
  [ ] Try to get wallet address from MetaMask
  [ ] use "background_color" if set on OpeSea asset
